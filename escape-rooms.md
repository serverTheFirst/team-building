Escape rooms are fantastic opportunities for teams to let loose, but also work together on team challenge. Participants have up to one hour to solve a series of clues that lead to a common goal in a themed setting. I provide below some recommendations for who should play, but I would strongly suggest any of these games for any team. My recommendations below are based on some quantifiable data and some gut feel, but any team will benefit from doing an escape room as a team building exercise.

**Dreadnaught** *(4-8 players)*

*Thematic Objective*: You and your team have 60 minutes to repair the submarine and stop the missiles from launching.

*Puzzle Concepts*: Dreadnaught features a wide variety of puzzle concepts designed to stimulate players with a wide variety of personality types/thinkers. Engineering minds will try their hands at the reactor cube while a language centered learner will do well with a different puzzle. All hands on deck for a big logic puzzle to get you into the final phase of the game. 

*Who should play*: Dreadnaught is a great option for teams that have to communicate technical concepts to non technical experts. A central puzzle offers a technical thinker a great opportunity to lead the team to the next challenge. It's also a great option for maintenance teams. The puzzles in this game are great for teams that have to do quick troubleshooting. 

**Death's Door** *(4-8 players)*

*Thematic Objective*: You and your team have 60 minutes to foil the horsemen's plans while they are out planning armageddon.

*Puzzle Concepts*: Death's Door is a thrilling puzzle adventure that offers 4 completely different sets, each designed to cater to different types of players. A quick early solve will give players momentum and they are immedeately greeted with a (if I do say so myself) very clever hands on puzzle. Each progression of puzzles focuses on different game design philosophies, and crescendos with some good old fashioned cyphers.

*Who should Play*: Death's Door is great for teams
