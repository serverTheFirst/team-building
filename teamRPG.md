Players will build a team from the ground up and face the unknown in an exciting tabletop rpg environment. From a team building perspective it hardly gets better than this. You start by assessing your project (the adventure plot) and then form a team designed to achieve the goal. 

This particular event needs a certain amount of creative buy in, but our game masters are engaging and dynamic storytellers and will help you find a participation level you are comfortable with.

If you are lookling for a team building event your team will talk about for months, this is it. This event is made even better with the addition of food and beverages.
